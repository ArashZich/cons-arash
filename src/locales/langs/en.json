    "faq_eyewear_q1": "How does virtual try-on work on the website?",
    "faq_eyewear_a1": "Our virtual try-on technology uses augmented reality (AR) to let customers preview products on their face before purchase. Using the device camera, the selected product is overlaid on the user's live image. Advanced algorithms ensure the product adapts to user movements and fits accurately based on facial recognition.",
    "faq_eyewear_q2": "What is the implementation process?",
    "faq_eyewear_a2": "Each product receives a dedicated AR link and QR code that can be easily embedded in the product page. You can either: Upload your existing 3D models to our platform and instantly receive AR links, Or send us product images (front and side views) according to our guidelines, and we'll handle the preparation",
    "faq_eyewear_q3": "How long does implementation take?",
    "faq_eyewear_a3": "After receiving product images according to our guidelines (front and side views), implementation typically takes 2-3 weeks depending on the number of models. With existing 3D models, implementation is much faster, taking less than 24 hours.",
    "faq_eyewear_q4": "Do we need to send physical products?",
    "faq_eyewear_a4": "No, we only need high-quality front and side view images of each product. If you have 3D models of your products, you can directly upload them to our platform.",
    "faq_eyewear_q5": "Is this solution compatible with our website?",
    "faq_eyewear_a5": "Yes, our solution works with all WordPress sites and custom-built websites. AR links and QR codes can be easily implemented on any platform."
